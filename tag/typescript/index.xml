&lt;p&gt;Experiment Launcher (temporary name) is a scientific utility aimed at storing the experimental results out-putted by a third party software. It allows the user to specify an experiment with a set of parameters andan executable file, and then proceeds to launch the executable and collecting the output. The output is then provided to the user in a human-friendly interface, recording important information such as the date and timewhen the experiment was launched, the parameters, and also the executable version (if version control is used).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WanRaptor is my first job as a Software Engineer and Project Manager with a big enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WanRaptor is an embedded system used to validate an application in a lab environment by emulating bandwidth limitations, latency, packets loss and jitter commonly found in WANs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involved the development from the ground up of the full-stack Graphical User Interface, including management of hardware resources, installation, secure licensing and user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WanRaptor is widely used in many laboratories all over United States and further.&lt;/p&gt;
